# AtariSamples
## We will build some exciting samples for Atari 2600
* We will be using Visual Studio Code as the editor
  * Visual Studio Code is cross-platform: Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux (and others)
  * The samples here are being developed on XUbuntu
* We will be using the Atari Dev Studio plugin for Visual Studio Code to compile and run the programs
  * Batari Basic compiler is used to compile the code into assembly
  * DASM is used to compile the code into machine language
  * Stella is an Atari emulator used to run the resulting program
